## About The Project

This is a simple order matching and filling engine in Rust as an experiment in how Rust handles ownership and lifetimes in a complex and asynchronous process.

## Built With

Built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ðŸ¦€

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust
- Cargo

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

2. Run the tests

```sh
cargo test
```

3. Run the application

```sh
cargo run
```

4. Build the binary

```sh
cargo build
```

## Usage

Don't use this in production, please. For experimentation only.

## Testing

To test the API, `cargo run` and then, in another terminal, fire off these curl commands to test post and get requests of the server.

- Create an order `POST /orders`

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/orders -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"is_buy": true, "price": 100, "quantity": 10, "priority": 1, "owner_id": 123}'
```

- GET a list of the open orders `GET /orders`

```sh
# TODO
```
